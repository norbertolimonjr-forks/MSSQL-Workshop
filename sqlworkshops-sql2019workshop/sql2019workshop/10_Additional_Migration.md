In this section of the module you will learn about additional capabilities in SQL Server 2019 including:

- Features in the Database Engine based on the Voice of the Customer

<h3><b><a name="voicecustomer">The Voice of the Customer</a></b></h3>

All the capabilities you see in SQL Server 2019 are based on some type of feedback from our customers. While you have seen major capabilities in SQL Server 2019, there are other new features we have added to this release all based on the voice of the customer and customer feedback.

This list includes but is not limited to:

- Columnstore stats in DBCC CLONEDATABASE
- Estimate compression for Columnstore indexes
- Diagnostics for auto stats blocking
- The #1 voted customer feedback item of all time: String Truncation Error Message
- Troubleshoot page resource waits with new built-in T-SQL
- Custom capture policy for the Query Store
- MAXDOP and Memory Config during Setup
- Reduce recompiles for tempdb workloads
- Indirect Checkpoint Scalability

You can get more details about all of these in our documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/what-s-new-in-sql-server-ver15.

As work towards a migration to SQL Server 2019, you need to consider a planned process for pre-migration, migration, and post-migration. We have provided a series of tools to help with this process.

In addition, database compatibility can become an important solution to make migrations easier and reduce the risk of upgrades.

Consider watching the following video called **Modernizing SQL Server** by Pam Lahoud and Pedro Lopes to get the complete picture of migration and database compatibility.

<h3><b><a name="langext">Migration Tools</a></b></h3>

As you plan for a migration to SQL Server 2019, consider looking at the process to perform a pre-migration assessment, your options to migrate, and post-migration optimizations. The following diagram outlines tools we provide for these scenarios:

The following tools are available to help you in this process:

- **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)**

Download and use this free tool to assess the configuration of your SQL Server and database. You can read more about DMA at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/dma/dma-overview.

- **Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA)**

Download and use this free tool to assess the performance of your queries using a replay/compare method. Read more about DEA at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/dea/database-experimentation-assistant-overview.

- **Query Tuning Assistant (QTA)**

Use the power of Query Store along with the "knowledge base" of the SQL Engineering team to optimize queries after you migrate and want to look at moving to a newer database compatibility level. You can read more about QTA at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/upgrade-dbcompat-using-qta.

- **SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA)**

Migrate your schema and data from other database products into SQL Server using SQL Server Migration Assistant. You can read more about SSMA at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssma/sql-server-migration-assistant.

In addition, if you need to lift and shift a SQL Server Virtual Machine directly to Azure take a look at the **Azure Site Recovery** Service at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/migrate-tutorial-on-premises-azure.

<h3><b><a name="voicecustomer">Database Compatibility</a></b></h3>

Database Compatibility Levels can be a powerful solution to reduce the risk of upgrades to the latest releases of SQL Server. This includes protection of functionality and query plans. Microsoft is encouraging developers to use database compatibility as a method to *certify* an application vs a version of SQL Server.

Read all the details of using Database Compatibility Levels for upgrades at https://aka.ms/dbcompat.
